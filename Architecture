Architecture/ Tech Stack 
Frontend: 
React Native / Expo 
We are doing this because we have familiarity with it and it supports cross platform development for iOS and Android. 
Authentication:
Firebase auth- https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth 
Easy to use and can be integrated with multiple languages/ platforms 
Most commonly used
Backend:
Rest API calls to the Backend 
Have experience with RestAPI calls 
Flask framework - know how to use and have used before
Storage/ scalability - AWS S3/ cloudflare 
Content based recommendation system - cosine similarity and tf-idf type algorithm - for mvp, this can just be done in python by Convert book descriptions & metadata into numerical representations, Compute similarity scores between books, Return books with the highest similarity scores.
If we want to make it more complicated we can use

need to check in on prices but has been tested on book s and is easily integratable  
Databases:
MongoDB for book metadata
Books have a lot of flexible fields (multiple genres, missing information potentially)  so it's easier to store more complex data there - might be able to also do SQL tho cause using API for book data 
SQLite for caching local data 
Use Python for scripting 
PostgreSQL for storing structured data 
Have experience with both of these and creating databases 


APIs
Google Books API 
Retrieve extensive book information, including titles, authors, descriptions, and cover images, need this so that we can create a book database, pretty extensive - go to api for book information 
Open Library Book API 
Same information as google books API, has many different search and list creation features that can be integrated into users page and allows for criteria based searching
Discourse - to add discussion features seamlessly
