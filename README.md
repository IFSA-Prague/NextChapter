Goal: To create a social media platform that encourages book completion, helps readers discover books worth their time and money, and fosters a vibrant reading community through book-club-style discussions.

Description: NextChapter is a social media platform designed for readers to track their progress, engage in meaningful discussions, and discover books tailored to their interests. By integrating book completion incentives, personalized recommendations, and interactive book club features, NextChapter builds a community-driven space where readers can connect, share insights, and stay motivated to finish their next great read.

Target Group: Our target audience includes both avid and occasional readers who are active on social media, primarily ranging from late teens to early thirties. We aim to engage those who aspire to make reading a hobby but struggle to do so consistently on their own.
Value Proposition: NextChapter enhances the reading experience by combining social engagement with personalized book discovery. It provides structured accountability through book clubs and discussion groups, motivating readers to complete books while fostering a sense of community. Unlike traditional platforms that focus solely on reviews or recommendations, NextChapter integrates interactive features that support engagement throughout the reading journey.

Problem Description: Many people want to read more but struggle with motivation, pacing, and finding the right books. While social media plays a significant role in book discovery, it often lacks a structured way to encourage book completion. Readers frequently lack a community that shares their reading speed or taste, making discussions difficult. Additionally, fear of spoilers discourages engagement during the reading process.

User Research Findings: 
Most participants use social media (TikTok, YouTube, Goodreads, Reddit) to discover new books. Avid readers also frequent bookstores and make selections based on book content rather than online reviews alone.
While some readers actively participate in book discussions, many prefer to observe rather than engage.
Community-driven accountability, such as buddy reads or book clubs, increases motivation to complete books, especially when there's anticipation of post-reading discussions.
A lack of discussion stems from the difficulty of finding people with similar reading speeds or book preferences.
Fear of spoilers limits engagement during the reading process.
Book completion is driven by a sense of fulfillment, even when parts of a book are slow or unengaging.
Other key motivators for finishing books include quality of writing, level of engagement, and excitement in the story.
Readers who purchase books are more likely to finish them.
A shared reading pace within a community can encourage consistent progress.

Key Features:
Spoiler Control: A feature that censors certain comments or discussions until the user marks the book as finished (similar to Letterboxd).
Progress Tracking: Users can log their reading progress and set goals for book completion.
Book Club Integration: Readers can join virtual book clubs that match their reading pace and interests.
Personalized Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions based on reading habits, social interactions, and book preferences.
Discussion Forums: Interactive spaces where readers can engage in guided discussions without fear of spoilers.
