**Members:** Sanjana Yadav, Vienna Parnell, Vivian Park  

**Goal:** To create a social media platform that encourages book completion, helps readers discover books worth their time and money, and fosters a vibrant reading community through book-club-style discussions.

**Description:** NextChapter is a social media platform designed for readers to track their progress, engage in meaningful discussions, and discover books tailored to their interests. By integrating book completion incentives, personalized recommendations, and interactive book club features, NextChapter builds a community-driven space where readers can connect, share insights, and stay motivated to finish their next great read.

**Target Group:** Our target audience includes both avid and occasional readers who are active on social media, primarily ranging from late teens to early thirties. We aim to engage those who aspire to make reading a hobby but struggle to do so consistently on their own.

**Value Proposition:** NextChapter enhances the reading experience by combining social engagement with personalized book discovery. It provides structured accountability through book clubs and discussion groups, motivating readers to complete books while fostering a sense of community. Unlike traditional platforms that focus solely on reviews or recommendations, NextChapter integrates interactive features that support engagement throughout the reading journey.

**Problem Description:** Many people want to read more but struggle with motivation, pacing, and finding the right books. While social media plays a significant role in book discovery, it often lacks a structured way to encourage book completion. Readers frequently lack a community that shares their reading speed or taste, making discussions difficult. Additionally, fear of spoilers discourages engagement during the reading process.

**User Research Findings:** 

* Most participants use social media (TikTok, YouTube, Goodreads, Reddit) to discover new books. Avid readers also frequent bookstores and make selections based on book content rather than online reviews alone.  
* While some readers actively participate in book discussions, many prefer to observe rather than engage.  
* Community-driven accountability, such as buddy reads or book clubs, increases motivation to complete books, especially when there's anticipation of post-reading discussions.  
* A lack of discussion stems from the difficulty of finding people with similar reading speeds or book preferences.  
* Fear of spoilers limits engagement during the reading process.  
* Book completion is driven by a sense of fulfillment, even when parts of a book are slow or unengaging.  
* Other key motivators for finishing books include quality of writing, level of engagement, and excitement in the story.  
* Readers who purchase books are more likely to finish them.  
* A shared reading pace within a community can encourage consistent progress.

### **Key Features:**

* **Spoiler Control:** A feature that censors certain comments or discussions until the user marks the book as finished (similar to Letterboxd).  
* **Progress Tracking:** Users can log their reading progress and set goals for book completion.  
* **Book Club Integration:** Readers can join virtual book clubs that match their reading pace and interests.  
* **Personalized Recommendations:** AI-driven suggestions based on reading habits, social interactions, and book preferences.  
* **Discussion Forums:** Interactive spaces where readers can engage in guided discussions without fear of spoilers.

   
**User Research:** 

**Methodology:**

We have conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Participants were selected based on Screener questions.

**Research Questions:**

1. How do readers discover and decide what book to read next?  
2. How do people enrich their reading process through communities?  
3. What factors influence reading enjoyment and completion?

**Participant one**

1.    
   1. Generally uses goodreads, youtube channel called Booktube, authors that are liked already, used to go to the library and just read book synopsis to see if it was worth picking up  
   2. Mostly sci-fi and fantasy, can read some popular crime non-fiction but likes reading about the make believe   
   3.  Sometimes ask friends and a few goodreads reviewers with similar tastes to find books  
2.    
   1. Yes, likes to discuss books with friends after they’ve read them or if they were recommended but its harder to find people with the same pace of reading    
   2.  Tend to engage with friends over the phone or through goodreads comments, will occasionally read a reddit thread and comment if feeling particularly passionate   
   3.  In smaller groups or with people they know, prefers discussion, otherwise would rather observe  
   4. A lot more motivated through sharing, incentivized to actually finish a book if it was known that a friend was waiting to discuss  
   5. Not really, like previously stated, active on goodreads and sometimes reddit  
3.    
   1.  Finish 70 percent of books  
   2.  Try to stick it out unless the pacing is too slow or  just run out of time, tend to be an all or nothing reader   
   3.  If keeps checking phone while reading or if book seems more like a chore to finish   
   4.  If I want to engage with content about the book or want to talk to someone about interesting things that are happening with the characters or the plot, overall eagerness to finish and discuss    
   5. Do not want to come across any spoilers, will try to read faster to engage  
   6. Not really, just try to get through depending on how busy they are 

**Interview interpretation:**

* **Personalized Recommendations & Social Discovery:** This participant relies on Goodreads, BookTube, and trusted reviewers for book discovery, suggesting that NextChapter should integrate personalized recommendations influenced by both algorithms and community-driven suggestions.  
* **Flexible Community Engagement:** Prefers discussing books with close friends after finishing but is mostly a passive observer in larger discussions, indicating that NextChapter should offer both active participation and low-commitment engagement options like upvoting or reacting to discussions.  
* **Reading Motivation & Completion Support:** Tends to finish 70% of books but struggles with slow pacing or distractions, so features like buddy reads, progress check-ins, and spoiler-free discussion groups could encourage completion without adding pressure.  
* **Adaptable Reading Structure & Spoiler Sensitivity**: Reads at their own pace but speeds up to avoid spoilers, highlighting the need for NextChapter to offer optional structured reading groups while ensuring spoiler-protected discussions

**Interview Interpretation:**

* Very socially-driven reader who relies heavily on peer influence; chooses books through friend recommendations, discusses actively with friends, and would be motivated to read more by "fear of missing out."

**Conclusions**  

1.  Most participants use social media (Tiktok, Youtube, Goodreads, Reddit) to find new books. It seems that generally more avid readers still frequent bookstores and make judgements based on the books themselves.  
2. While some readers actively participate in book discussions, **many prefer to observe rather than engage**. Community-driven accountability, like buddy reads or book clubs, can significantly increase motivation to complete books, especially when there’s anticipation of post-reading discussions. Lack of discussions seems to come from lack of people around the participants who share the same reading pace or taste in books. *However, the desire to avoid spoilers often limits engagement during the reading process.*  
3. Book completion is usually motivated by a sense of fulfillment when finishing the book (even if it is boring in some parts the end result brings something to the table.) Other factors are quality of writing, engagement (how exciting the book is), *Those who buy books are more likely to finish books.* Pacing could be motivated by a community of readers at the same pace.

\*spoilers may play an important factor in our app. It would be beneficial to have a feature that censors certain comments/discussions until the user indicates having finished the book. (like letterboxd)

**Tech Stack:**

The main arch components \- backend / fronted / database.  
I would also like to see some API specified if you are using any \+  
reasons why you choose this / that. Programming language also kind of  
relates to architecture choice so specify it as well. Any libraries  
being used should be there as well.

**Architecture/ Tech Stack**   
Frontend: 

* React Native / Expo   
  * We are doing this because we have familiarity with it and it supports cross platform development for iOS and Android. 

Authentication:

* Firebase auth- [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)   
  * Easy to use and can be integrated with multiple languages/ platforms   
  * Most commonly used

Backend:

* Rest API calls to the Backend   
  * Have experience with RestAPI calls   
* Flask framework   
* Storage/ scalability \- AWS S3/ cloudflare   
* Content based recommendation system \- cosine similarity and tf-idf type algorithm \- for mvp, this can just be done in python by Convert book descriptions & metadata into numerical representations, Compute similarity scores between books, Return books with the highest similarity scores.  
  * If we want to make it more complicated we can use   
    * [https://www.recombee.com/?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.recombee.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)   
    * [https://www.qloo.com/products/api](https://www.qloo.com/products/api)  
      * need to check in on prices but has been tested on book s and is easily integratable  

Databases:

* MongoDB for book metadata  
  * Books have a lot of flexible fields (multiple genres, missing information potentially)  so it's easier to store more complex data there \- might be able to also do SQL tho cause using API for book data   
* SQLite for caching local data   
  * Use Python for scripting   
* PostgreSQL for storing structured data   
  * Have experience with both of these and creating databases 


  
APIs

* [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)   
  * Retrieve extensive book information, including titles, authors, descriptions, and cover images, need this so that we can create a book database, pretty extensive \- go to api for book information   
* [Open Library Book API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)   
  * Same information as google books API, has many different search and list creation features that can be integrated into users page and allows for criteria based searching  
* Discourse
